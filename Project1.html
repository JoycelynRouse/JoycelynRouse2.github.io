    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project uses an ETL process and aims to analyze the relationship between employee satisfaction and patient outcomes, as well as assess employee retention and recruitment efficiency. By examining these factors, I seek to enhance patient care quality and improve overall healthcare services.</p>

    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <p>The data used for this project comes from Kaggle.</p>
    
    <h3>Link to Data Source</h3>

    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Excel</strong>: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data integrity before analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>SQL</strong>: Employed to query the cleaned data, allowing for efficient analysis of relationships between employee satisfaction and patient outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Tableau</strong>: Utilized to create interactive visualizations and dashboards, effectively showcasing key findings and trends in the data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Business Problem</h2>
    <p>The project addresses critical issues in healthcare by examining the relationship between employee satisfaction and patient outcomes. It aims to optimize recruitment strategies, enhance training and development, and improve resource allocation for chronic disease management. By analyzing diagnosis trends, the project also helps forecast future service demand, enabling proactive planning. Ultimately, it seeks to improve the quality of patient care while fostering a more engaged and satisfied workforce.</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>What is the correlation between employee satisfaction and patient outcomes?</li>
        <li>How does the recruitment source affect employee job satisfaction?</li>
        <li>Are employees with certifications or awards providing better patient care?</li>
        <li>What are the long-term diagnosis trends for various diseases?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Data Analysis Process</h2>
    <p>The data analysis involved cleaning the dataset in Excel, querying it using SQL to identify key patterns, and visualizing the results in Tableau. The focus was on employee satisfaction metrics, patient quality of life scores, and the effectiveness of chronic disease management.</p>

    <h2>Dashboard / Visual</h2>
    <p>The dashboard created for this project showcases various visualizations, including a bar chart for diagnoses per disease, a pie chart comparing preventive care uptake by gender, weekly trends in diagnoses, and KPIs indicating total diagnoses for the current and previous years.</p>

    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding 1: There is a slight correlation between employee satisfaction and patient quality of life scores.</li>
        <li>Finding 2: Employees sourced from referrals tend to report higher job satisfaction.</li>
        <li>Finding 3: Employees with certifications generally have higher performance metrics in patient care.</li>
    </ul>
